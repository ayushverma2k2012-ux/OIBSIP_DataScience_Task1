Iris Flower Classification ‚Äî Machine Learning Project

## üìò Objective
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate classification models that can accurately identify the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its physical measurements such as sepal and petal dimensions.

## üß© Steps Performed

### 1. *Data Loading*
- Used the *Iris dataset* from the sklearn.datasets library.
- Loaded features and target values into pandas DataFrames for easy manipulation.

### 2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
- Displayed dataset shape, feature samples, and class distribution.
- Visualized relationships between features using *pair plots* and histograms to understand separability between species.

### 3. *Data Preprocessing*
- Split the dataset into *training and testing sets* using train_test_split.
- Scaled the features using *StandardScaler* for better model performance.

### 4. *Model Training*
- Implemented two classification algorithms:
  - *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*
  - *Random Forest Classifier*
- Used a *Pipeline* for streamlined preprocessing and training.

### 5. *Model Evaluation*
- Evaluated accuracy on test data.
- Displayed *confusion matrices, **classification reports, and **cross-validation scores*.
- Compared models to determine the most efficient classifier for this dataset.
